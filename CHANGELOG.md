# Changelog

All important local changes to VeloDom are recorded here. The project is not
published yet, so entries describe development milestones rather than released
package versions.

## 2026-07-04

### Added

- TypeScript 6 and ESLint 10 development quality gates.
- Public framework contracts and generated declaration files.
- A TypeScript application example at `/features/typescript` while the blog
  remains Vanilla JavaScript.
- Standalone HTML template compiler under `packages/compiler`.
- Shared directive contracts under `packages/shared`.
- VeloDom Vite plugin under `packages/vite-plugin`.
- Generic route matcher with nested routes, dynamic params, query strings,
  metadata, guards, redirects, and configurable 404 handling.
- Formal page and component lifecycle with `mounted`, `destroy`,
  `onCleanup`, and `AbortSignal`.
- Configurable auth-provider runtime and optional server-session/localStorage
  provider helpers.
- Minimal plugin setup/cleanup contract.
- Structured resource-adapter validation.
- Blog showcase pages and reusable post-card, modal, and demo-panel
  components.
- Compiler, adapter, router, lifecycle, plugin, auth, middleware, and HTTP
  Node tests.

### Changed

- Migrated framework core, adapters, compiler, shared contracts, and Vite
  plugin source from JavaScript to TypeScript.
- Production builds now require type checking, ESLint, and declaration
  generation before Vite bundling.
- Application imports use the public `velodom` package boundary.
- Moved Vite-specific `import.meta.glob` discovery out of `src/core`.
- Application routes, middleware, resources, auth providers, and plugins are
  injected through `createApp`.
- Added one public framework entry at `src/core/index.ts`.
- Preferred page/component filenames are now `script.js` or `script.ts` and
  `config.js`; legacy filenames remain compatible.
- Preferred template syntax is `vd-*`; legacy `data-vd-*` remains compatible.
- Request cancellation now follows superseding requests and owner unmount.
- Core error hints no longer assume a particular application directory.

### Fixed

- Prevented bindings and nested directives inside inactive `vd-if` branches
  from evaluating unavailable data. Directives resume reactively when their
  branch becomes active.
- Made component `expose` members available to the component's own template as
  well as parent refs, fixing undefined handlers such as `announce()` and
  `close()`.

### Removed

- Legacy demo pages and components that duplicated the blog showcase.
- Application-owned middleware from the old core request location.

### Verification

- `npm test`: 35 tests passing.
- `npm run build`: production build successful.
